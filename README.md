# Rails Simple Chat Demo

Exploring several solutions (Ajax polling, WebSockets with Faye, HTML Server-Side Events) for asynchronous commenting using Rails.

See SitePoint's [Mini-Chat with Rails](http://www.sitepoint.com/mini-chat-rails/), [Realtime Mini-Chat with Rails and Faye](http://www.sitepoint.com/realtime-mini-chat-rails-faye/), and [Mini-chat with Rails and Server-Side Events](http://www.sitepoint.com/mini-chat-rails-server-sent-events/) tutorials by Ilya Bodrov for more information.

The `master` and `sse` branches contain the code for Server-Side Events. The basic chat, Ajax polling, and Websockets with Faye versions are all located in similarly named branches.
